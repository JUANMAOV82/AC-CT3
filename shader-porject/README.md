# Synthetic Relationships
Communication lies at the core of all media. From speech to the written word, from radio to social networks - the core function of media has been to enable and facilitate communication. In this project we're going to take on this radical approach to communication, and try to get to the root of mediated exchange. We will examine how data is collected, how it is transformed into information, how it can be encoded, transmitted, and decoded. In the process we will encounter the need to build contextualized systems of meaning: systems of representation that maintain internal coherence, but might not make a lot of sense when seen from the outside.

My partner and I construct two electronic beings capable of perceiving some aspects of the environment around them. Then we connect them into a network that would enable them to communicate their findings, and respond to the communications of their counterpart.
